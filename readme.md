Columns

Eventually this will be a columns clone for the Atari Falcon030. It may be ported to the ST, right now it's using the Falcon's true colour mode.

This is a WIP, and my first major assembly projcet. There's plenty to clean up and fix, and I'm pretty sure there's a bug in the match 3 code but that's a problem for tomorrow (stated on the 8th of August, 2015). It might be fixed by 2020. There's also some extra junk for doing simple sprites and tiles. 


Thanks

Massive thanks to the Dead Hackers Society (www.dhs.nu) for their DHS Falcon Demosystem which is used to set the screen modes and a whole lot more, and to Nyh! for his joystick code. Also thanks to Laurent S (Thados) and dml (www.leonik.net/dml/sec_atari.py) for invaluable advice.
