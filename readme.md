Columns

THis is a work-in-progress columns clone for the Atari Falcon030. It may be ported to the ST, right now it's using the Falcon's true colour mode despite only using 6 or so colours. 

This is my first major assembly project so there's plenty of code that's nowhere near optimised. There's plenty to clean up and fix, and more to implement.

There's also some extra junk for doing simple sprites and tiles because I was thinking about making a shooter at first, that may be used for something in this at some stage.


Thanks

Massive thanks to the [Dead Hackers Society](www.dhs.nu) for their DHS Falcon Demosystem which is used to set the screen modes and a whole lot more, and to Nyh! for his joystick code. Also thanks to Laurent S (Thados) and dml (www.leonik.net/dml/sec_atari.py) for invaluable advice.
