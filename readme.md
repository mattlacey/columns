Columns

Eventually this will be a columns clone for the Atari Falcon030. It may be ported to the ST, right now it's using the Falcon's true colour mode.

This is a WIP, and my first major assembly project. There's plenty to clean up and fix, and plenty more to implement (as in most of the game). There's also some extra junk for doing simple sprites and tiles because I was thinking about making a shooter at first.


Thanks

Massive thanks to the Dead Hackers Society (www.dhs.nu) for their DHS Falcon Demosystem which is used to set the screen modes and a whole lot more, and to Nyh! for his joystick code. Also thanks to Laurent S (Thados) and dml (www.leonik.net/dml/sec_atari.py) for invaluable advice.
